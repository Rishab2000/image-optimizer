# image-optimizer

Python script that converts all your images in a folder to webp. It is optimized to reduce storage by around 50%, however you can always tweak the settings. 

Clone the repository onto your local preferably (ease of an access) on your root level folder. Once done, on the terminal, navigate to the folder with the images you want to convert and run the following command:

/usr/bin/python3 ~/{replace with the path of cloned folder}/convert_to_webp.py


Runnings this will create a new folder called "webp_output". 

Processing time will vary based on volume and settings.
